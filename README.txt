Program that sets up the exhaustive-search knapsack problem.
It reads lines from standard input in the following format.
The first line contains a single integer giving the capacity of the knapsack.
The remaining n lines each consist of two integers. The first integer is the item’s weight, and the second integer is the item’s value.
A sample input file appears like this:

10
7 42
3 12
4 40
5 25

This also counts the number of basic operations performed by the program. This is for Data Structures and algorithm analysis.
